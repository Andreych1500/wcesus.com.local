  <ul class="stan-list">
    <li>Any personal information provided (for example, name, schools attended, courses taken, grades received, etc.) may be used for the purpose of evaluating an applicant's credentials. Our employees, agents, and contractors will have access to this information as necessary to perform their duties.</li>
    <li>
      Personal information will not be released to a third party except in the following circumstances:
      <ul>
        <li>To comply with a judicial order, subpoena, lawful requests from governmental authorities or other legal requirements, to exercise our legal rights or to defend against any legal claims or actions brought against WCES;</li>
        <li>To contact designated recipients of evaluation reports, educational institutions the applicant has attended and governmental institutions/agencies for additional information and/or verification of the authenticity of the applicant's credentials;</li>
        <li>To inform appropriate persons (academic institutions, government agencies, professional organizations and other evaluation services) in cases where documents submitted to WCES are reported to WCES by the appropriate persons not to be authentic or to be forged, altered or falsified;</li>
        <li>To prevent or protect against fraud or illegal activities;</li>
        <li>To institutions, agencies, or other recipients as designated by the applicant.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>WCES will confirm, without the necessity of any further consent from the applicant, whether or not an evaluation report was issued by WCES.</li>
    <li>Except as stated above, WCES will not sell or distribute any information provided to any third parties. However, WCES may summarize information about its applicants, including the services requested, and provide this to affiliated organizations, educational institutions, and governmental institutions/agencies. Such summaries will not contain any personally identifying information regarding any applicants, except as otherwise provided herein.</li>
    <li>WCES uses a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of its applicants' personal information that it receives online. These actions include sophisticated encryption and authentication tools. All applicants' personal information obtained online is maintained within secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights and who are required to keep the information confidential.

To provide "state of the art" customer service, WCES uses cookies on its website so that it can track how users navigate through the WCES website.

  <b class="iH3">Watch out for Phishing</b>
  <p>"Phishing" refers to emails sent to individuals containing authentic-looking messages that instruct them to provide sensitive personal information. Individuals who "bite" are exposed to identity theft. Phishing occurs when an individual receives a deceptively-legitimate looking email from what appears to be a reputable company.
